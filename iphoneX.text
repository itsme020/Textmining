    May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

    The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use \"in the box\" accessories like \"EarPods with Lighting Connector\", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

    My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone <U+0001F622> Better Go for shop To buy apple products .

    In my opinion, don’t  think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the differencePros-1. Best Camera2. Best Security3. Long day Battery Life4. Touch ID improved5. Its an iPhone after all . <U+0001F60D>6. Best Night-mode support7. Best Processors A13 Bionic ChipCons-1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn’t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 83. Thick bezelsGuys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!

    This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

    Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.

Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone <U+0001F622> Better Go for shop To buy apple products .

    In my opinion, don’t  think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the differencePros-1. Best Camera2. Best Security3. Long day Battery Life4. Touch ID improved5. Its an iPhone after all . <U+0001F60D>6. Best Night-mode support7. Best Processors A13 Bionic ChipCons-1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn’t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 83. Thick bezelsGuys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!

    The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

    This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

    Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.

    May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

    The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use \"in the box\" accessories like \"EarPods with Lighting Connector\", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

    Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.

    May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

    The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use \"in the box\" accessories like \"EarPods with Lighting Connector\", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

    My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone <U+0001F622> Better Go for shop To buy apple products .

    In my opinion, don’t  think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the differencePros-1. Best Camera2. Best Security3. Long day Battery Life4. Touch ID improved5. Its an iPhone after all . <U+0001F60D>6. Best Night-mode support7. Best Processors A13 Bionic ChipCons-1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn’t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 83. Thick bezelsGuys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!

    This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer.

So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

    The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use \"in the box\" accessories like \"EarPods with Lighting Connector\", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

    My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone <U+0001F622> Better Go for shop To buy apple products .

    In my opinion, don’t  think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the differencePros-1. Best Camera2. Best Security3. Long day Battery Life4. Touch ID improved5. Its an iPhone after all . <U+0001F60D>6. Best Night-mode support7. Best Processors A13 Bionic ChipCons-1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn’t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 83. Thick bezelsGuys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!

    The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

    This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

    Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.

    May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.
